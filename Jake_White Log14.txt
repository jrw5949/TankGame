I am making a very rare two-dimensional top down tank survival game where I put the player at the helm of using flashy intuitive controls to defend yourself against incoming waves of enemy tanks. This tank game uses graphics, hit detection, and enemy tank AI.
I anticipate gamers from around the world will want to play my game, specifically gamers that like 2d top down games and also any casual gamers that currently own a PC. This product will be a top seller in our video game business line in no time. The game is a unique survival game with multiple dimensions of fun. It can be replayed so people can improve their score as they play it more.  This could lead to a demand for a second more extended version to the game in the future something competitors don’t currently have.  We should make this tank game because it is a unique approach to the survival genre and allows casual gamers and non-gamers to hop in very quickly, play for a long period of time and it will them leave them wanting more.
