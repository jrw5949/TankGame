The project I want to work on is a 2D top down GUI based game.

I want to work on this project because I think it will be a fun and interesting
challenge. Also I like to play games and would like to learn how to make a simple one.

To successfully complete the project, I will need to improve my Java skills in 
these areas: I need to improve my use of the MVC model. Also I need to learn to use
Action Listeners and game mechanics such as when a shot hits an enemy. Then I need
to improve my use of GUI interfaces to create a fun and entertaining game.

I will need to learn new Java skills in these areas: GUI, Action listeners, and MVC

I will have the following challenges to overcome in implementing my project using 
the MVC design pattern: I need to make sure to appropriately put the correct methods
and code into the correct MVC areas. Also I will need to separate the GUI, mechanics, and
action listeners into different areas of the MVC
 
Explain whether and why you will use Swing or Fx to complete your project. 
How familiar are you with Swing and Fx? I will be using Swing to create a simple GUI
based game. Swing will include different GUI elements that will be needed in order to
create a successful game. I have used Swing before a bit in IST 242.

Why should I believe that you can complete the project you propose on time, with 
working code that demonstrates the features you will promise for each deliverable?
I have experience with MVC from IST 242 and have a general idea of the game in which
I want to design. I can always make the game more simple or more complex based on the available time I have to deliver each deliverable.
