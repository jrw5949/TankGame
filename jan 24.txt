Jake White - jrw59491. Describe, from a user's point of view, the useful functionality you plan to implement in your first deliverable for your project.I plan on first making a basic window that will display a main menu with options to choose "play" and "tutorial". The user can click on one and it will pull up a new window with the game or the tutorial instructions about how to play the game. In The first deliverableI am planning on making the tank move up, down, left and right using WASD. Also, if I have enough time I can also add the shooting feature with spacebar.2. Describe how you plan on implementing that functionality in Java.I plan on first making the MVC model and then making a main menu through JFrame and JButtons and other GUI based elements. Then I will useaction listeners to see if a user clicked on "play" or "tutorial". After that I will pull up a new JFrame with other GUI based elements. I will use action listeners to track if a user hits WASD or spacebar. This will then translate to movement of the tank or shooting.3. Explain, from a user's point of view, what subsequent functionality you plan to build into your application in deliverables 2-4.In deliverable 2-4 I will add basic enemy AI, power ups, unlocks system, different levels, game modes, and many other options. I can make this game more complex or less complex depending on how the development of the game is going. If all goes well I hope to have different tanks and ammo the user can pick from that they can unlock by playing the game. New tanks could be faster, slower, have more health, shoot faster, etc. New ammo can be stronger, faster, slower, etc. Different game modes could include an "endless" mode, survival mode, power up mode, etc. The limit to the depth of the game all depends on how the development process goes.
