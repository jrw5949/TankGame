In thinking about the class, what were your objectives, and were they achieved?My objective of the class was to be able to apply what I learned in my pervious java classes to the weekly graded programs and to improve on my MVC skills. Early on in the class I figured out a strategy to start programs as early as possible and come to class with questions if I had any issues that I could not figure out. By the end of the semester I become a better java programmer and learned how to implement MVC structure into my programs. It was not easy and I had to put a lot of time into this class.  Describe what part or aspect of the class was the most useful and why.I found that the openness and availability to the professor and the TA was very helpful. If I was not able to find information about things needed in my programs and project they were there to ask questions to. I did learn to research new concepts on my own more in this class then my other java class. This has prepared me to tackle issues I may not have had experience with in the past making me feel like I improved on researching java concepts. Describe what part or aspect of the class was the least useful and why.I would like to have seen more lectures on the new concepts that would be needed in our programs. I would also like to have seen more lectures and examples posted to Canvas to be used as resources when working on programs out of class. If you could make one change to the course, what would it be and why?I would like to see the MVC model taught earlier in the course.  As I had a very hard time understanding the use of this model in my project and programs.  Add any other comments you would like to make about the class experience that might help me improve the course.I would think about adding more lecture time and maybe a little less open work time into the course.  This might help students not feel so frustrated when trying to work through programs outside of class.
